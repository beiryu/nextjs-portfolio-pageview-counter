## üèõ **Gameplay description**

### Characters

1. **List of characters**
   See the attached file "ListHero.txt".

   When the program starts up, it will load the heroes from "ListHero.txt" and store them in a list/vector.

   Each line in the file is the info of a hero; structured as follows:

   \<hero name>;\<attribute>;\<health>;\<attack>;\<defense>;\<attack speed>

   **Example:** Treant Protector;Wood;700;62;1.5;38

   The Hero list can be updated/added from the keyboard and stored in the "ListHero.txt" file.

2. **Character stats**

   Each Hero has four stats:

   - Health: if the health stat reaches 0, the character will be considered dead.
   - Attack: the strength of the damage dealt to the opponent.
   - Defense: the ability to resist part of the opponent's attack strength.
   - Attack speed: the time for 1 cycle of a Hero's attack, the smaller the stat, the faster the attack speed, and vice versa.

   **Example:**

   There are two Heroes currently in a duel:

   1. Sniper;Fire;454;36;2;29
   2. Troll;Earth;620;48;2.5;15

   Assuming Sniper attacks Troll, Troll will lose (36-2.5 units of health) (Troll will have 586.5 units of health left) and 29 milliseconds later Sniper can attack again.

### A**ttributes**

Each Hero will belong to an elemental attribute in the Five Elements (Gold/Wood/Water/Fire/Earth). In the ListHero.txt file, it is saved as: Fire/Water/Metal/Earth/Wood.

As the Five Elements exist in pairs of mutual generation and mutual restraint as shown in the image below:

<div align="center">

</div>

Should: Follow the rule in which Heroes will buff or counter each other's stats when fighting against each other or together in a team.

### Fighting Together

**Counter:** If a Hero is countered, their time to attack will increase by 10%.

_Example:_ If there are two Heroes in the same team, one with the fire attribute and the other with the water attribute, the fire attribute Hero's attack speed will slow down (attack speed increases by 10%).

**Synergy:** If two Heroes have a synergistic relationship, the Hero that is being helped will gain an additional 15% health.

_Example:_ If there are two Heroes in the same team, one with the earth attribute and the other with the metal attribute, the metal attribute Hero will gain an additional 15% health.

### Fighting Against

If a Hero is countered, their defense will decrease by 50% and the counter-attacking Hero's attack will increase by 10%.

_Example:_ In a fight between two Heroes, one with the wood attribute (health 400, attack 30, defense 3) and the other with the earth attribute (health 500, attack 35, defense 2), when the wood attribute Hero attacks the earth attribute Hero, the stats of both Heroes will be: Wood Hero (health 400, 33, 3) | Earth Hero (health 500, 35, 1).

### Battle

1. **Winning and Losing**

   Heroes will fight in pairs, following the initial order.

   The winning team is the team with more surviving Heroes.

2. **Time**

   If fighting against an NPC, the default time for a match is 1 minute.

   If two players fight against each other, the match time will be agreed upon by the two players via the keyboard (see section 3.7).

3. **Environment**

   After both sides have chosen their list of Heroes, the system will randomly select an environment for the battle from 5 attributes (metal/wood/water/fire/earth).

   Therefore, the stats of the Heroes will change according to the following rules:

   | Property of the head >< Property of the Hero | Effect on stats                  |
   | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Same                                         | Stats remain the same as default |
   | Mutual promotion                             | HP stats will increase by 5%     |
   | Mutual promotion                             | Speed stats will decrease by 10% |
   | Mutual restraint                             | HP stats will decrease by 3%     |

### User battles NPC

NPC will randomly choose 3 heroes from the list of heroes loaded from the ListHero.txt file.

The system displays the list of heroes for the player to choose from.

The player will choose 3 heroes by entering the number corresponding to the hero's position in the list from the keyboard.

### User battles User

The operation is on the same interface on the same PC.

After logging in, User 1 will choose the User vs User mode.

User 1 chooses 3 heroes.

User 2 chooses 3 heroes.

User 1/2 chooses the time for the match: there are 3 options 1 minute (1000); 2 minutes (2000); and 5 (5000) minutes.

## **Result**

The results will be displayed on the screen and automatically saved to the Log.txt file.

For example, displaying on the screen:

Ti win

---

Team Ti - Team Teo

---

Treant Protector:452;62;1.5;38 - Sniper;0;36;2;29

---

Trasex:3;40;2;27 - Lanaya;Water;0;53;4;29

---

Troll:0;48;2.5;15 - Naga Siren;0;56;6;32

- Each line represents the information of a match.
- The information is stored in the following structure: \<time hour/minute/second/day/month/year>\<Player 1|NPC name>\<List of Player 1|NPC's Heroes>\<Player 2>\<List of Player 2's Heroes>\<Result>
- Players can view the match history in the log file (only displaying the time on the screen); if they want to see the detailed information of a specific match, they need to provide the time from the keyboard.
